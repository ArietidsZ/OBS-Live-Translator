- Feature target: This project should be able to dynamically switch among three profiles (low, medium and high) based on hardware resources utilisation, and ensure a seamless and automatic transition between profiles. The project should be able to set up with one click, and autonomously identify the optimal configuration, automatically downloading optimised model files that best fit this set of hardware. Every part or subdivision of the project's functionality or feature should be written in the programming language and structure that best suits its purpose.
- Performance target: The “low” profile targets hardware resources with no more than 4GB RAM, along with two cores from the Ryzen 9500F. The medium profile targets hardware resources with no more than 2GB VRAM on an RTX 5060 and 4GB RAM, along with two cores from the Ryzen 9500F. The “high” profile targets hardware resources with no more than 8GB VRAM on an RTX 5060 Ti and 8GB RAM with six cores from the Ryzen 9500F. The efficiency target is to avoid any bottlenecks in performance, which means being able to fully saturate the computing units with a single audio stream, without requiring parallelism. The performance target is to achieve a pipeline latency of no more than 100-500 ms, with near state-of-the-art accuracy. Note that there is a natural difference in the sequence of different languages, so it should be able to rearrange the final translation based on the context.
